# Nice.Framework
A convention-over-configuration framework for .NET development (component libraries and MSBuild extensions).

The convention is to use the *Visual Studio* as the IDE of choice. This (in 2016 still) implies the projects being built with the *MSBuild* tool.
This works well with the *Team Foundation Server*, but should also work with any other continuous integration (CI) solution that supports MSBuild.
Of course, in this day and age, one should use *NuGet* for dependency management.

TODO The convention also includes a specific project layout on the file system.
